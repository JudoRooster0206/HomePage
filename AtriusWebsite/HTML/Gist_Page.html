		<h2>It's in our nature</h2>
		<p> Though insecurity is one of the least favourable traits out there, it's ok to feel as if others should like you, because it's in our nature to want to be loved.</p>

	<h2> Weaknesses </h2>
	<ul><h3>
		<li> You try to break habits but fail and excuse yourself. </li>
		<li> You fail to stop your mind from sidetracking</li>	
		<li> You're afraid to be considered a failure.</li>	
		<li> You don't like doing stuff out of your actual comfort zone (your phone and mind).</li>	
		<li> You're afraid to leave your head to focus on the world around you. </li>
		<li> You take things at face value, never bothering to find deeper meanings to them.</li>
		<li> You're impatient in your learning.</li>
		<li> Most of your goals entail little more than just doing it without a big picture to work towards.</li>
		<li> You lose sight of the big pictures you do set.</li>
		<li> When someone questions your skills, you're offended instead of attentive and observant.</li>
		<li> You let imaginary foes tell yourself to not do something.</li>
		<li> You're mind conjures imaginary threats.</li>
		<li> You hold onto to irrelevant events that only hurt or make you feel like shit.</li>
		<li> You close yourself of from the world, believing your inner world to be all that matters. Then wonder if you really matter to anyone.</li>
		<li> You look at practicing skills and testing yourself to be discomfortable.</li>
		<li> You don't debate your ideas, philosophies, or motives nor always stay true to them. Some exist only to make yourself feel smarter and more open minded.</li>
		<li> You always seem to push off things, lose sight of your inner fire, and forget how cool of a person you are and the kinda of person you want to be.</li>
